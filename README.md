# From now on, if you come back and say something like:

- “Remember that Milanote-like board app I built?”

- “Continue work on my GitHub Pages board app”

- “I want to add feature X to my nested boards app”

# I’ll already know:

- what the app is,

- how it’s structured,

- which files matter,

- and what design decisions were made (grid-based, inline editing, no backend, etc.)
